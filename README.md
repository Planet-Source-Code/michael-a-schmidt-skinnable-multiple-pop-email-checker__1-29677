### Description

Multiple POP email checking utility. Skinnable. Encrypts passwords. Right click on tray icon for popup menu, left click on tray icon for popup summary of your email accounts.

I have been meaning to pull this together for awhile now, this is a mail control I wrote quite a while back. I wrote this program using my control to check mutliple accounts, then added Jeff Deaton's skin application. I ran out of time so the code is not very efficient or readable, so good luck working with it and have fun. =)
